		     "What makes me an inspiration? I set my mind to something and did not stop until I got what I wanted. I have created a makeup brand that inspires women to feel beautiful and confident while enhancing their natural beauty. I have also had the opportunity to be on reality tv and inspire women in the world of fashion."

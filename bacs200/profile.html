		<p>
		Hello, my name is Taylor Todd. I am a Junior majoring in Marketing at UNCO. I grew up in Brighton,CO and now live in Greeley after transfering to attend school here from Nebraska. When I am not at work or spending time with family, I enjoy doing interior design and online shopping. After I graduate from college, I hope to get a job in sales where I can create relationships with clients and still have time to travel.

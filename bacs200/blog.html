				<h2>Social Implications</h2>
				<p>&lt;Homelessness has been an issue that seems to be gaining more popularity in recent years. It is an issue that involves social issues, economic issues (poverty), mental health, and a lack of community or togetherness. In combination with these factors, homlessness is not a "one size fits all". In the United States of America, homelessness is classified as " “lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence, and if they sleep in a shelter designated for temporary living accommodations or in places not designated for human habitation." This definition is broad, but gives a good idea of how people can suffer from this issue.</p>

				<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
				<p>&lt;People that are homeless rely on other people to give them money rather than earn an income. In recent reserach conducted by the secretary of United States Housing and Urban Development "...between shelters and emergency rooms and jails, it costs about $40,000 a year for a homeless person to be on the streets."" That money cpuld be used to enhance a community and its members. The homeless also consume many public resources that at times become neglected and will not generate revenue for communties. &gt;</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>&lt;Homelessness is an issue that needs to be talked about more in our society these days. I am not saying that it needs to be praised, or frowned upon. Instead, it needs to have more exposure and eduation on the topic. People need to be aware of the leading causes of homelessness to prevent judgemnet but also prevent the problem from growing more out of hand. It would be a good idea for communities to create a comittee that can educate teens on homelessness but also create support groups to help the homeless get jobs, and the support they need to get back on their feet again.
